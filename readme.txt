Stop WordPress Spam

== Description ==

Stop spam emails, spam comments, spam registration, and spam bots in general.

*Created with a lot of hard work and maintained by Keith P. Graham (from 2010-2017). Thank you Keith.*

*Maintained (because I love this plugin and want to keep it alive) by myself, Bryan Hadaway (since 2017).*

***♥ this plugin too? You can help me [maintain it](https://github.com/bhadaway/stop-spammers) or by [making a donation](https://stopspammers.io/donate).***

***Need help? Read the [FAQs page](https://github.com/bhadaway/stop-spammers/wiki/faqs) first, then post on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bhadaway/stop-spammers/issues).***

== Installation ==

Go to *Plugins > Add New* from your WP admin menu, search for Stop Spammers, install, and activate.

OR

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Upload the plugin folder to your wp-content/**plugins** folder.
3. Activate the plugin from the plugins page in the admin.

Either way, Stop Spammers works right out-of-the-box, without needing to adjust any settings. However, if you need it, there are many settings that can be adjusted.
